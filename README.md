## Air Canvas

# Overview
Air Canvas is an innovative project developed using Python and OpenCV in the realm of computer vision. This application provides users with a real-time, interactive experience to draw on the screen using hand gestures. By leveraging computer vision techniques, Air Canvas allows you to create digital art without the need for any physical toolsâ€”just wave your hand, and the canvas comes to life.

# Features
Real-Time Drawing: Draw on the screen in real-time using hand movements. The application tracks the position of your hand and translates it into strokes on the digital canvas.
Gesture Recognition: The system uses hand gesture recognition to identify when and where to draw on the screen.
Color Selection: Choose different colors to draw with by using specific gestures or keyboard shortcuts.
Brush Size Control: Adjust the thickness of your brush strokes on the fly, allowing for detailed artwork or bold lines.
Eraser Functionality: Easily switch between drawing and erasing, giving you full control over your creations.

# Technology Stack
Python: The core programming language used to develop the application.
OpenCV: A powerful computer vision library that handles real-time video capture, hand tracking, and gesture recognition.
Numpy: Used for efficient numerical operations and handling image data.

# Usage
Launch the application and ensure your camera is connected.
Use your hand to draw on the screen.
Change colors or adjust brush size using the provided gestures or keyboard shortcuts.
Press the designated key to clear the canvas or exit the application.
